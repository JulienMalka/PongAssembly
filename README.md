# PongAssembly

This is a pong written in assembly for a nios II processor. Such a processor can be found in my other github repo **NiosProcessor**.

This code was written in collaboration with Antoine Crettenand during the course *Computer Architecture* from EPFL.

Some of the design (such as the general organisation of the project) is belonging to the team of the course.
